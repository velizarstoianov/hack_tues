    <h1 style="font-size:54px; font-family: Verdana;"> What is breadboard?</h1>
          <p>A breadboard is a widely used tool to design and test circuit. You do not need to solder wires and components to make a circuit while using a bread board. It is easier to mount components reuse them. Since, components are not soldered you can change your circuit design at any point without any hassle.</p>
          <p>It consist of an array of conductive metal clips encased in a box made of white ABS plastic, where each clip is insulated with another clips. There are a number of holes on the plastic box, arranged in a particular fashion. A typical bread board layout consists of two types of region also called strips.</p>
          <p>Bus strips and socket strips. Bus strips are usually used to provide power supply to the circuit. It consists of two columns, one for power voltage and other for ground.</p>
          <p>Socket strips are used to hold most of the components in a circuit. Generally it consists of two sections each with 5 rows and 64 columns. Every column is electrically connected from inside.</p>
    


  <h1 style="font-size:54px; font-family: Verdana;">How to use breadboard?</h1>
  <p>A breadboard is a construction base for prototyping of electronics. Originally it was literally a bread board, a polished piece of wood used for slicing bread. In the 1970s the solderless breadboard (a.k.a. plugboard, a terminal array board) became available and nowadays the term "breadboard" is commonly used to refer to these.</p>
   <p>This course covers all of the details necessary for the user to understand the mechanics of protoboards, there use, how to set up power and ground and how start with a schematic and the indicated electronic components (resistors, capacitors, transistors, etc.) and properly recreate that exact circuit on a protoboard.</p>
  
  <p>The primary teaching tools for this course is an instructor led PowerPoint presentation that uses diagrams, photos and short instructional videos, so that the student can follow along with the instructor to develop the knowledge and skills required to properly and effectively use protoboards in the design and testing of electronic designs and projects.</p>
